Think about DNF proof
generate test set!
make sure OG algorithm is working

at some point:
Disable all heuristisc on DP so we can check its still correct


Wednesday:

Afternoon - Dynammic Programing speed up
-ONLY FIND words for first 20 indexes!!
-Make sequence global in scan_words
-array for Dynammic P

Week
Test set
code review and clean!!

DONE WITH BUILDUP!!

FRIDAY:
clean up combinatorial words
Plan next week



NOTES FOR BUILDUP/NEWORD:
-keep track of words at each index -> will make wordset check faster
-process words by sequene index not sequence by sequence (few issues here)


DP and Buildup are virtually done
-run DP with no word cap

NEXT WEEK:
Clean up kWindowProb
-allow us to get one word at a time!
-optimize combinatoric section a little more (not priority)
-->This should make naive super fast

-Get original heurisitc code working again (don't worry about speed up, maybe just think about how to remove word)

-1 more idea - build up with extension where you limit the locations where words can be sampled from!?

-Generate Testset and begin evaluating!
